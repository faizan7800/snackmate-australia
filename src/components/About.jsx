          I and my husband both are big foodies ourselves. We came to Australia a few years back to explore this beautiful country and it’s food and culture. We have enjoyed the adventure and have got a lot of love from people here, but at the same time we really miss the authentic North Indian flavors and food, which is very difficult to find.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2 text-gray-400 font-lora">
              We tried many Indian food joints but our taste buds didn’t really get that immersive and blissful experience which we so long for. And thats when my husband and I started planning our food baby which we call out of love 'SnackMate'.
